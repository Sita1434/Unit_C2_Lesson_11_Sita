  <p> One day, I was sitting in class, bored out of my mind. Because I had my computer out, I decided to go to
    <a href="https://www.boredbutton.com/random" target="_blank"> Bored Button</a>, a website that generates random websites for you. That was fun, but after about 10 minutes, I was bored again. So then, I decided to go to
    <a href="https://jupitered.com/?home=1" target="_blank">Jupiter</a> and check on my grades. Nothing had changed since the last time I had checked the website, so it didn't take me long before I was bored yet again. After that, I decided to go to the website
    <a href="https://www.icp.org/" target="_blank">ICP</a>. ICP stands for the International Center for Photography, and it is a photography museum in NYC. While I was browsing the website, I found a bunch of photos by a photographer I like called Elliot Erwitt. I looked through his photos for a while, and three of his photos really stuck with me. By the time I was done looking at them, the class had finished.
